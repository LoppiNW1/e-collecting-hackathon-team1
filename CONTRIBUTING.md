## Code of conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people
who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting merge requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual
language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public
or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the
Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be
reported by emailing the organizers of the Energy Data Hackdays.

This Code of Conduct is forked from the Energy Data Hackday's code of conduct which is itself 
adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org), version 3.0,
available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/).
