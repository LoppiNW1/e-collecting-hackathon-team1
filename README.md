# E-Collecting Hackathon â€“ Team 1

> This hackathon contributes to laying out different ways on how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated:
>
> 1) **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram(s)** showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of your solution
> 2) Figma Mockups/wireframes and user flow showing the user experience of your solution
> 3) Explanation of features used (if applicable)
> 4) A requirements file with all packages and versions used (if applicable)
> 5) Environment code to be run (if applicable)


## Approach

*A brief description of your approach.*

## Architecture and Data Flows

*Find below an example for an architecture and a data flow diagram*

    Customer->>WebApp: Browse menu, select pizza (menu data)
    Customer->>WebApp: Submit order (pizza, address, payment info)
    WebApp->>Backend: Create order {pizza, address, payment}
    Backend->>DB: Save order {orderId, customer, items, payment}
    Backend->>Restaurant: API: send order {orderId, items, address}
    Restaurant-->>Backend: Ack/Confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Backend-->>WebApp: Show confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    WebApp-->>Customer: Order confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Restaurant->>Driver: Notify driver {pickup, delivery}
    Driver-->>Restaurant: Pickup ack
    Driver->>Customer: Deliver pizza
    Driver->>Backend: Update status {orderId, delivered}
    Backend->>WebApp: Status update {delivered}
    WebApp->>Customer: Show status {delivered}
