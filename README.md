# E-Collecting Hackathon â€“ Team 1

## Approach

*A brief description of your approach.*

## Documentation

This hackathon contributes to laying out different ways on how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated:
1) **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram(s)** showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of your solution over time.
2) Mockups/wireframes and user flow showing the user experience of your solution (using e.g. Figma)
3) Explanation of features used (if applicable)
4) A requirements file with all packages and versions used (if applicable)
5) Environment code to be run (if applicable)

*For your reference, you will find below an example for two diagrams showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of ordering a pizza via a third-party delivery website over time.*

### Flowchart: High-level Process

An overall process flow showing the main steps and system/actor interactions for ordering a pizza online via a delivery website, including software, infrastructure, and handoff to the restaurant and delivery driver.

```mermaid

    Customer([Customer])
    DeliverySite("Delivery Website (Web/App)")
    Backend("Website Backend Server")
    OrderDB[(Order Database)]
    Restaurant("Restaurant Order System")
    Driver("Delivery Driver")

    Customer-->|"Place Order (Pizza+Details)"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Send Order Data"|Backend
    Backend-->|"Store Order"|OrderDB
    Backend-->|"Send Order to Restaurant"|Restaurant
    Restaurant-->|"Ack/Confirmation"|Backend
    Backend-->|"Confirmation & ETA"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Show Confirmation"|Customer
    Restaurant-->|"Assign/Notify Delivery"|Driver
    Driver-->|"Pickup & Deliver"|Customer
    Driver-->|"Update Status"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Show Status"|Customer

```

### Sequence Diagram: Detailed Interactions & Data Flows 

A step-by-step illustration showing how data and requests are exchanged between actors (customer, delivery site, restaurant, infrastructure), and key software components in the order process.

```mermaid

    participant WebApp as "Delivery Website (UI)"
    participant Backend as "Backend Server"
    participant DB as "Order Database"
    participant Restaurant as "Restaurant System"
    actor Driver as "Delivery Driver"

    Customer->>WebApp: Browse menu, select pizza (menu data)
    Customer->>WebApp: Submit order (pizza, address, payment info)
    WebApp->>Backend: Create order {pizza, address, payment}
    Backend->>DB: Save order {orderId, customer, items, payment}
    Backend->>Restaurant: API: send order {orderId, items, address}
    Restaurant-->>Backend: Ack/Confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Backend-->>WebApp: Show confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    WebApp-->>Customer: Order confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Restaurant->>Driver: Notify driver {pickup, delivery}
    Driver-->>Restaurant: Pickup ack
    Driver->>Customer: Deliver pizza
    Driver->>Backend: Update status {orderId, delivered}
    Backend->>WebApp: Status update {delivered}
    WebApp->>Customer: Show status {delivered}

```
