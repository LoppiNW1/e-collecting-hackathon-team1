# E-Collecting Hackathon â€“ Team 1

> This hackathon contributes to laying out different ways on how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated:
>
> 1) **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram(s)** showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of your solution
> 2) Figma Mockups/wireframes and user flow showing the user experience of your solution
> 3) Explanation of features used (if applicable)
> 4) A requirements file with all packages and versions used (if applicable)
> 5) Environment code to be run (if applicable)


## Approach

*A brief description of your approach.*
