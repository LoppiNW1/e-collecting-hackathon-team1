# E-Collecting Hackathon â€“ Team Title

At the Federal Chancellery's E-Collecting Hackathon (October 31 and November 1, 2025, in Bern), we will design and develop solutions for collecting signatures for popular initiatives and referendums electronically. The links between the individual implementation options and the predefined topics (link to current white paper) are intended to facilitate political assessment within the framework of participatory dialogue and an official decision in light of the criteria mentioned. 

The implementation options should show the extent to which and on the basis of which characteristics they address or counter the issues and challenges listed in the topics. The options should use possible user interfaces to present the user journey of the respective actors (namely voters, committees, voter registration authorities, Federal Chancellery), the overall architecture, syntax, and semantics of the data flows between the actors, as well as explanations and justifications for the design in as comprehensible manner. The implementation variants can be presented using clickable or technical prototypes developed at the hackathon.

## Approach

*A brief description of your approach, a link to the detailed description of your approach and what you have already created (if applicable). Which skills do you need for your team?*

## Documentation

This hackathon contributes to laying out different ways on how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated:
1) **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram(s)** showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of your solution over time.
2) Mockups/wireframes and user flow showing the user experience of your solution (using e.g. Figma)
3) Explanation of features used (if applicable)
4) A requirements file with all packages and versions used (if applicable)
5) Environment code to be run (if applicable)

*For your reference, you will find below an example for two diagrams showing interactions and data flowing between actors, software and infrastructure components of ordering a pizza via a third-party delivery website over time.*

### Flowchart: High-level Process

An overall process flow showing the main steps and system/actor interactions for ordering a pizza online via a delivery website, including software, infrastructure, and handoff to the restaurant and delivery driver.

```mermaid

    Customer([Customer])
    DeliverySite("Delivery Website (Web/App)")
    Backend("Website Backend Server")
    OrderDB[(Order Database)]
    Restaurant("Restaurant Order System")
    Driver("Delivery Driver")

    Customer-->|"Place Order (Pizza+Details)"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Send Order Data"|Backend
    Backend-->|"Store Order"|OrderDB
    Backend-->|"Send Order to Restaurant"|Restaurant
    Restaurant-->|"Ack/Confirmation"|Backend
    Backend-->|"Confirmation & ETA"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Show Confirmation"|Customer
    Restaurant-->|"Assign/Notify Delivery"|Driver
    Driver-->|"Pickup & Deliver"|Customer
    Driver-->|"Update Status"|DeliverySite
    DeliverySite-->|"Show Status"|Customer

```

### Sequence Diagram: Detailed Interactions & Data Flows 

A step-by-step illustration showing how data and requests are exchanged between actors (customer, delivery site, restaurant, infrastructure), and key software components in the order process.

```mermaid

    participant WebApp as "Delivery Website (UI)"
    participant Backend as "Backend Server"
    participant DB as "Order Database"
    participant Restaurant as "Restaurant System"
    actor Driver as "Delivery Driver"

    Customer->>WebApp: Browse menu, select pizza (menu data)
    Customer->>WebApp: Submit order (pizza, address, payment info)
    WebApp->>Backend: Create order {pizza, address, payment}
    Backend->>DB: Save order {orderId, customer, items, payment}
    Backend->>Restaurant: API: send order {orderId, items, address}
    Restaurant-->>Backend: Ack/Confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Backend-->>WebApp: Show confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    WebApp-->>Customer: Order confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Restaurant->>Driver: Notify driver {pickup, delivery}
    Driver-->>Restaurant: Pickup ack
    Driver->>Customer: Deliver pizza
    Driver->>Backend: Update status {orderId, delivered}
    Backend->>WebApp: Status update {delivered}
    WebApp->>Customer: Show status {delivered}

```
